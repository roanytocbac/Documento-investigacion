According to \textcite[p.~205]{wynne2008core}: ``despite the central role of this concept, there is still no consensus on how best to go about measuring core inflation''; and he adds: ``a common shortcoming is the absence of a well-formulated theory of what these measures of inflation are supposed to be capturing.'' In practice, nevertheless, central banks have developed several ad hoc criteria in order to evaluate, rank and select measures of core inflation.\footnote{See \textcite[p.~9-10]{bankofcanada2021renewal} for a recent application of the most usual criteria for assessing core inflation measures.}
